# Contributing to Icon Library

We welcome contributions! Hereâ€™s how you can help:

## Adding New Icons
1. Create your icon as an SVG file.
2. Add the SVG to the `icons/` folder.
3. Update the `icons.css` file to include the new icon.

## Testing Changes
- Open `index.html` in your browser to test the changes.

## Code Style
- Use consistent naming conventions for icons (e.g., `bb-iconname`).
- Keep the CSS clean and well-organized.
